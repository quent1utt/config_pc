# config_pc

## Introduction 
The aim of this project is to create a stationary PC configurator that will allow the user to choose, based on several lists of components, his own configuration. The configurator will be created so that the user does not have to worry about the compatibility of the elements between them.

In addition, the configurator allows you to generate a PDF that summarizes the configuration.

## Description

- First, the "store" (left) made up of drop-down lists that contain a library of computer components. These lists are dynamic. Indeed, they react and propose only the compatible elements between them. A visual of the selected component is displayed below the list.

- The second part is called the "basket" (right). Indeed it reproduces the basket of commerce websites. It displays the product characteristics (performance, price) in order to give an overview of the details of the components. It has "delete" buttons that allow ease and speed in choosing and comparing different configurations.

- The third part allows you to view the overall cost of the configuration as well as to validate the configuration to generate the PDF.
